Design opens up fast SiGe devices Researchers at IBM have built an experimental p-channel mosfet that uses both silicon and germanium and delivers high performance .	24	performance_performance12200
Improved performance is obtained through building an ultra-thin channel of silicon-germanium alloy under the silicon surface of the mosfet to restrain mobility of the charges carrying current through the device .	1	performance_performance12200
On the other hand , the required energy coupling capacitors cause problems and can be expensive at higher current levels , and there does not seem to be any proof that there is a volume , weight , or cost saving over the standard Buck topology for any given equivalent performance level .	50	performance_performance12200
Nevertheless the Cuk converter topology seems likely to remain an outsider until a true trade-off comparison can be made between Cuk and Buck at a series of realistic equivalent performance levels , a task that would take a lot of time , but whose results would be of great interest to many in the power supply design field .	29	performance_performance12200
