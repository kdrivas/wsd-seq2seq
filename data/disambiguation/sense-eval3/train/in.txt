This subtype of glutamate receptor endows long-term potentiation with Hebbian characteristics , and allows electrical events at the postsynaptic membrane to be transduced into chemical signals which , in turn , are thought to activate both pre - and postsynaptic mechanisms to generate a persistent increase in synaptic strength .
Input-specificity is explained by the need for the presynaptic terminal to provide a sufficient concentration of L-glutamate to activate adequate numbers of NMDA receptors .
For example , it has been suggested that constitutively activated PKC is involved because H-7 , which inhibits the activity of the catalytic subunit , but not sphingosine , which prevents the initial activation of PKC , can depotentiate synapses in a reversible manner even when applied up to 3h after induction .
Two independent sets of afferent fibres converging on a common population of cells are activated by stimulating electrodes placed either side of the extracellular recording electrode .
The stimulus intensities are adjusted so that S1 activates fewer fibres than S2 .
Chemically-induced potentiation usually occludes with tetanically - induced LTP , suggesting a convergence of mechanisms ; in general , chemically induced LTP is not blocked by NMDA antagonists , presumably because the components of the LTP cascade activated by the various agents lie downstream from the NMDA receptor .

From the letters we have been receiving this year it appears that the Jehovah 's Witness from Greece Andreas Christodoulou has been passing some of the cards on to his colleagues who are also imprisoned Jehovah 's witnesses , who want to correspond with people in the U .

Some publications are less impartial than they might appear , erring on the side of generosity .
The article appeared in an Italian magazine Metro , who had intended to pay 300 for an article ; but when Johns ' dealer , Leo Castelli , knew that Steinberg was considering an article , he arranged for the magazine to offer 1,000 , paying the difference of 700 himself .
We have already looked at writing in catalogues , and can now turn our attention to the critical responses which appear in articles .
The photographs were taken over a period of ten years , and eventually they were brought together in a book in 1960 ; ten of the book 's essays originally appeared in Vogue , where the appealing mix of an artist 's conversation along with Liberman 's descriptions and commentary succeeded well .

Roth would appear to believe both the claim and the counter-claim as to the value of the text , and to believe , too , both that the Roth part of the book does not represent an exercise of the imagination and that it does .

At the same time , the article is tainted by what seems to be a desire to inflict damage on Levi 's reputation , of a kind which may be thought to serve the ideological tendency of the magazine in which it appeared .
The magazine 's line on such matters would also appear to be remote from , and distinctly harder than , that taken in its dying days by the Reagan Administration .
Levi can sometimes appear incapable of fiction , but it is no less apparent that everything he wrote was fiction .
Such things are celebrated in his stories with a richness and unction which might appear to make a renegade of Babel and certainly of Levi .
One of Kelman 's stories , Greyhound for Breakfast , the last in the collection of that name which appeared in 1987 , is , to my mind , a masterpiece .

Despite the official socialist tendencies of these two parties , a substantial number of their voters do not appear to question the maintenance of a capitalist-type class structure in a new Ireland .
But none of these groupings ever came near to threatening the dominance of Unionist Party organization , much less the solidarity of protestant loyalists , which always appeared total on the issue of incorporation into a united , independent Ireland .
If the tradition still exists today and it appears that it very much does so it implies that the United Kingdom does not have for many loyalists a natural character of statehood in the way the Southern state has for catholic nationalists .
It appears to be increasingly the case that there are two major traditions of identity perception among protestant loyalists .
The cause in both cases appears to be the strength of catholic nationalist and protestant loyalist popular consciousness and the way in which the cultural and material interests of the subordinate classes appear to be represented by the alliances themselves and their institutions .
The key event in the history of Ireland which appears to encapsulate Ulster protestant faith in God through Christ and the destiny of Ulster protestants as a people , is the war of 168991 .
However , that myth is not quite the one which appears to have penetrated everyday life , perhaps because the place of the victory is located within the borders of the Southern state .
freedom of belief and action within certain parameters , which are to be decided either by those who appear righteous in the sight of God or by those who , at least , conform in their lawmaking to the advice given to them by the righteous .

The members of his party appeared to know nothing about the opposition of the hierarchy to the earlier Bill , and Dr Browne only found out in October/November 1950 .
This appears to be the first contradiction which the bishops later sought to resolve by withdrawing from the direct contact method .
This , however , was the only contradiction which appears to have been solved by the 1960s .
Many of them appear to have been angered and disappointed at the church 's suppression of the proposed scheme .
In addition , the clergy appear to have considerable difficulty in recognizing the transformation which theoretical positions on Christian belief and morality undergo as they are concretized in historical human relationships , doubtless also because of the strong essentialist bias in their perception of socio-ethical issues .
The authority of the clergy had been second to none during the years of persecution and this appears to have strengthened as a direct result of Roman centralization from the 1850s onwards .
This respect for authority has appeared throughout the examples given , but it has also been shown to be a respect within certain limits .
The position taken by the protestant churches , and the newspaper articles and television debates which preceded the referendum appear to have affected public opinion .
There appears to have been a general feeling among them that there was no real problem on this score .
FitzGerald had been determined as far back as 1964 to make constitutional changes to those articles which appeared to alienate Northern protestant opinion .
Fianna Fil appeared to be equally divided on the issue .
The Church of Ireland appears to have had this in mind when it invited the well-known English Roman catholic marriage consultant , Dr Jack Dominian , to provide a report on divorce for the Church of Ireland General Synod .
The children probably appear as a source from which to develop new relationships and the immediate perception is to translate this experience into scholastic terms .
The main grounds appeared to be the danger which it might pose to the small Southern protestant minority by encouraging mixed marriages .

Modern serving equipment including beer machines and even slop trays had appeared .
Thus the arguments for easier maintenance and greater longevity of plastic windows appear to have little foundation in fact an argument often ignored by the brewers .

LEISURE DESIGN IS IMPORTANT WHY is it that hotel owners and operators put so much emphasis on recruiting professional hotel designers to create the right hotel , but , when it comes to the inclusion of leisure facilities , then they appear to approach any designer , with the impression that it can be addressed from a design viewpoint just like any other area .

We have to view a stimulus for a finite time before it generates a perception , but that perception appears to us to occur instantaneously rather than fading into view like the Cheshire cat .
This pattern of findings would appear to be impossible to accommodate from the viewpoint of phenomenology .
Stevens in the 1930s and later , it has been recognized that , although the Weber - Fechner Law holds for many sorts of sensory experience , the exponent varies widely ; nevertheless , the principle of a quantitative correlation between external stimulus , neural activity and experienced sensation remains intact and now appears to be well-established .

3 For elderly people , the proposals appear to overlook the difficulties which they may face if , for instance , the contract for cataracts or hip replacements is placed at a hospital some distance away .

Birthday Offering Ashton 's technical virtuosity Choreographers who do not adhere strictly to the old conventions of court etiquette realise that their total design will flow more easily because their dancers ' behaviour will appear more spontaneous and natural .
These edicts were particularly important for all concerned in the opera-ballets in which the king himself frequently appeared at the climax of the action .

They conform to the same technical rules as ports de bras and must appear to pass through the centre line of the arm from shoulder to finger-tips and move within the two circles drawn by the elbows and hands .
This made the dancers appear as if they were a moving frieze .
The movements were strongly influenced by the stylised Bugako players and were appropriate to each scene , but oddly enough the whole appeared too static , as if a series of japanese prints was being paraded before the audience .
Nautical styles Although few characters from the professions appear to influence demi - caractre dance , the Navy and Army have regularly inspired choreographers .
It was then taken over by such excellent troupes as the Tiller and Jackson Girls who toured widely over Europe and America and later by the Drum Majorettes , who have also appeared in Balanchine 's works .
The footwork appears again and again in different enchanements during their other appearances , notably in the short solo for Mercutio when he dances in a more tragic vein just before he dies .
from their first confrontation , when Titania appears wilfully aloof as Oberon tries to exert his authority , to their final reconciliation , they stand out as a true Fairy King and Queen , who are not beyond suffering the moods and emotions of We mortals here .
But when she repeats the movement in her dance with the Young Man , it appears in a different context , that of awakening love .
2 Emphasis must be placed on certain steps and their qualities which appear to be particular to one country and dances should be limited to those which can be recognised .
This is after all what the first balletmasters did when professionals appeared on stage and were no longer surrounded by the court where all eyes were focused on the king .
Hungarian The couples frequently face each other looking into each other 's faces and appear to crouch over their feet slightly which emphasises the down to earth quality as most steps appear to go down into and not out of the ground .
Polish The boy 's way of appearing to guide his girl just in front of him in all travelling steps affects the carrige of both himself and his partner .
This is useful when telling a story , particularly as prostitutes appear in many ballets .
This is useful when telling a story , particularly as prostitutes appear in many ballets .
This gave greater depth to most of the patterns , but often made the dancers appear earthbound .
From time to time this can be very beautiful but because there is a lack of continuity in the dance movement from one picture to the next , the resultant work often appears static .
Alternatively , it may appear too acrobatic or athletic because the choreographer has been so concerned with the turning of the pages of a picture book that there is no explanation why one picture follows another and leads to another and yet another until the curtain falls .
Those of the arms are particularly interesting because the fists are either clenched or the fingers flattened thus the lines and shapes made only appear slightly rounded by the folds in the sleeves .
However , he is not definitely found as a brewer in any records that survive today until 1683 , when he appears in the register of St Dunstan 's , Stepney , as a brewer of Brick Lane .

In the long term there may even be Nicholson 's pubs appearing in the business centres of other cities .
Despite a vague assurance to the contrary last year , this useful list has not appeared since February .
But Rowland 's offer has been dismissed out of hand by Brent Walker and unless the bond holders , owed 102m in all , agree to the restructuring plan involving BW 's 47 bankers it would appear that the directors will have no other alternative but to put the company into receivership .
In this case it appears that the bolts have been placed , not for the purpose of protection , but to create an artificial gangway .
The BMC 's management committee , faced with what appears to be a fait accompli , must now decide what action , if any , can be taken .
Saunders has been commissioned to file reports on the expedition 's progress which will appear in The Observer throughout August .
In the spring a story appeared in The Observer under the headline Power-drill rock climbers accused of vandalism , of how a minority were threatening the relationship between landowners and climbers as a whole .
And as for damage to an historic monument , to wit Dumbarton Rock , and the subject of the piece in The Observer , the photograph that appeared alongside it gives the lie to this self-generated argument .
And even from the mainland there appeared to be a distinctly vertiginous southern edge to the island .
Patches of blue sky appeared ; it was time to go , to aim for the top , to get word to Dairena and Morag who must be wondering , waiting , worrying .
Yet climbers appear willing to put an inordinate amount of faith in a long line of brass nuts and then show surprise when they pull like a hot knife through butter .
The wires are soldered into the nut and the device appears well engineered .
My main fear , I think , is that bolt ladders will appear on beautiful , clean stretches of rock .
It would also appear that many of the people who abuse the code of these shelters are not members of the MBA , so contribute nothing to their maintenance .
Secondly , it appears that the military do not use Range West much .
CORDLESS DRILL WINNERS The winners of Black Decker 9032 cordless hammer action drills which were the prizes in a competition which appeared in the May issue of DIY are as follows .
DELTA DEBIT CARDS Yet another logo has appeared on the plastic card scene Visa Delta 's interlinking triangles .
The Book of Revelation , which Tolstoy said reveals absolutely nothing , is more heavily marked than anything else in the New Testament which Dostoevsky took to prison with him , and we know that huge overarching shapes like Baal , the Kingdom of Antichrist , are beginning to appear in his writing from the early 1860s .
There appeared a new strain of trichinae , microscopic creatures parasitic upon the bodies of human beings .
Dostoevsky 's home-made word does n't appear in Crime and Punishment ; it has been left behind in the much more theoretical Notes from Underground .
So the swine swine in God 's eyes too will appear on judgment Day immortal souls capable of penitence and knowledge .
which of course do appear in the novel .
The fictional morphology of this suffering is more aptly suggested by the novelist and critic Akhsharumov , writing the very year Crime and Punishment appeared in hard covers , who observes that Raskolnikov 's mental torment , which is his punishment in all but its public aspect , begins with his first promptings towards the crime .
On the surface of his mind lies the contrast between a trivial though tormenting fear and a monstrous scheme ; and beneath that contrast appears a positive contradiction .
Narration by the author , a sort of invisible but omniscient being who nevertheless does n't leave him meaning his hero ' for a moment So , after appearing to settle for third-person narrative , he doubles back on himself and leaves us to make what we can of an omniscient author who is bound hand and foot to a far from omniscient protagonist .
He appears to lose interest in life .
Svidrigailov appears not to notice insults and rudenesses .
And that is how the passage appeared in volume form , in the editions of 1867 and 1870 .
It will appear mechanical , when plucked out of the huge and vital narrative flow , that Dostoevsky has given him a sickly dark yellow complexion as a mark of his belonging to Petersburg .
A Napoleon is a non-person , a generalhuman ; and although the word does n't appear in Crime and Punishment itself , the notebooks make the point that one ca n't just live the general life of humanity .
Moreover the surname Shatov appears once in the notebooks relating to Crime and Punishment .
In the earlier Possessed notebooks Granovsky appears under his own name , and Peter Verkhovensky is often Nechaev .
In the earlier Possessed notebooks Granovsky appears under his own name , and Peter Verkhovensky is often Nechaev .
This must appear implausibly neat .
He appears to enjoy light reading .
Dostoevsky has an impudent way of making his narrator declare As a chronicler I confine myself to presenting events exactly as they happened , and it is not my fault if they appear incredible like the son of the house writing home about his time on the North-West Frontier of India .
And yet a novel does n't write itself , even if some of the very greatest ones appear to ; it is written by a man with aims and preferences .
748 Circuits , Systems and designs In the first of a regular series , we bring together some of the practical designs and circuits which first appeared in the US magazine EDN .
Change in publishing date Starting with the October issue , Electronics World + Wireless World will appear about week later than before .
Hence the October issue will appear on September 26 .
It would appear that isolating the set of pulses not marked with arrows would work equally well and , in fact , combining both in a suitable way could double the sensitivity .
Setting up If this all appears to work , an oscilloscope should show a pickup coil signal similar to Fig .
Corpuscular or particulate radiation appears in the form of protons and neutrons which take longer to reach the earth 's upper atmosphere than the higher energy radiations .
Many articles have appeared in the amateur radio press and elsewhere describing the many aspects of propagation and giving more detailed information on the theory of and effects of solar radiation on communications systems .
On the surface it would appear superior to Classes A and B .
Everything appears OK until he introduces the ferrite rod antenna .

The task is to follow lead car , which also appears on the screen , and travels at a varying rate .
Alarm messages appear on the screen if the chase car gets too close to , or too far from , the lead car .
At least this appears to be the conclusion of epidemiological studies about weak electro-magnetic exposure and cancer .
they try to make the load impedance , RL , appear to be very much higher to the main amplifier than it really is .
Despite the far greater sophistication of RDS , Carfax appears to remain the superior approach , permitting local traffic announcements to be made as soon as information is available to broadcasters .
Nearly ten years after Belsey 's book appeared , there has been no revolution in the first sense , and it does not look as if there will be .
I have attempted to take a rapid view of developments in critical theory , or criticism with a theoretical consciousness , as they have appeared in British culture in the past twenty years .

Her argument was that the subjects of the old master paintings could be disregarded by a painter who wished to find lessons for the present in the artistic practice of the past .
Later writers , even those sympathetic to Antal 's thesis , have admitted that the argument about class conflict in the period was exaggerated , but this does not exclude the possibility that an equally unexpected approach may not throw light on some apparently exhausted topic .
Of course , a theorist may damage an argument through bias , perhaps excluding relevant evidence inconvenient to the case being made ; but this is not a danger exclusive to theorists .
When works of art are described only those aspects of an image important to the argument are included .
This may be important in assessing how well a writer illustrates an argument .
The conclusion to the argument will be that there is a specific form of violence of a political kind outside of state control which can not be reduced to crime .
The argument is clearly inspired by a religious motivation and shows Ulster protestantism to be a vigorous form of political religion , approving whatever defensive measures are necessary to avoid submission to Rome rule .
When he was told of the hierarchy 's opposition to any bill of this kind , Dr Browne , himself secularly inclined , submitted his proposals and arguments to the hierarchy for approval , just as a previous Health Minister , Dr Walsh , had consulted Archbishop McQuaid on a similar matter in 1946 .
Part of the overall argument of this book is that , as the Roman catholic church is principal validator or legitimator of the Southern state along with the concept of the national entity , what that state goes on to do in the field of social ethics can not be separated out from the responsibilities of the church .
Large publicity campaigns began and the Irish Times also lent its weight to the pro-divorce argument , campaigning in its columns until the eve of the referendum in late June .
Large publicity campaigns began and the Irish Times also lent its weight to the pro-divorce argument , campaigning in its columns until the eve of the referendum in late June .
In opposing the arguments marshalled by the anti-divorce groups , the pro-divorce group argued that , despite the existence of divorce legislation in Northern Ireland , there was still a low divorce rate .
The Woods ' speech also introduced an important new argument which may have had some considerable effect on Irish voters .
Harry MacAdoo , then the Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin , on several occasions put forward the argument that Southern protestants were a minority group with their own culture and traditions , and thus deserved to have schools for themselves in order to hand on their own traditions .
When considering the merit of this argument , one does have to bear in mind the particularly precarious nature of the Southern protestant grouping .
When considering the merit of this argument , one does have to bear in mind the particularly precarious nature of the Southern protestant grouping .
In this writer 's view , the arguments against multi-denominational education and in favour of catholic schools support an overall political theology which is strongly based on authority within the church .
First it is necessary to consider the arguments used in the public debates .
Spencer 's argument has been banded about from time to time .
However , Greeley and Rossi 's work also has been used to uphold the defenders ' argument that , though Roman catholic schools varied in their efficiency , they were certainly better than any possible alternative in terms of producing good Roman catholics .
Finally , while it could be argued that Greeley and Rossi tell us something of catholic versus state schooling in the US , they have nothing to tell us about catholic versus Christian , multi-denominational schools , which is what most of the argument in Ireland is about .
But the central and substantive argument that defenders of Roman catholic schools have had to deal with is that the dual school system in Northern Ireland encourages , supports , or at least reinforces the sectarian divide , and that it forms part of the vicious circle maintaining conflict in Ulster .
Roman catholic church leaders have used additional local studies to refute arguments which treat Roman catholic schools as part of the Northern problem .
Unfortunately , the necessary link to warrant this second conclusion a control group of catholics in a multi-denominational situation was simply not available to Salters , and so the argument is void .
He works till lunch , then wanders into the kitchen and has long argument with Tony , or perhaps a discussion about the best way to cook trout or whether or not to sack the gardener .
But then Mr Clancy and Mr Venables , who had been standing by to offer encouragement , had fallen into an argument concerning position .
Here , from a late volume of The Scot Musical Museum , is the poem which clinches my argument .
When I found it , there was an argument and we went for each other .
When I found it , there was an argument and we went for each other .
Even a violent argument will leave you mentally high and quite unfit to fly .
Unlike the natural sciences , where discussion often starts with the results and ignores the methodology of the research , the social sciences and increasingly anthropology have developed an elaborate argument about the practices of doing research .

The argument is therefore not about police control or a utopia without controls , but to explore why some cultural behaviour has a history of police action and to discover where that behaviour fits into police ideology .
The argument is therefore not about police control or a utopia without controls , but to explore why some cultural behaviour has a history of police action and to discover where that behaviour fits into police ideology .
No one , of course , has asked to read it , for if my argument is correct the service has no need of any reminder of how the ideology works or how to implement the paradigms which support their cultural norms .
Many of our new counter-cultural deviants were articulate and presented very cogent arguments relating to their allegedly victimless crimes .
His friend James Menzies the wine merchant , in whose house he lodged , had said once , infuriated after a two-hour argument , Angus do you believe nothing completely .

Now he looked over at Cameron , taking stock of the quizzical lift of his right eyebrow when he looked out below his black fringe , the down-turn of his mouth under his long curved nose , and began to recapitulate his argument with care , uncomfortably aware that Angus might think he was trying not to sound drunk .
He turned to James in amazement and saw that he was enjoying his surprise , as though it confirmed one of his arguments .
In his mind Cameron continued the argument throughout the meal .

I was n't interested in argument , philosophy I took the simple biblical past Having no father I tried to capitalise , resolve the Oedipal struggle , good feelings .
The most primitive physicalist response to this argument is to deny the claim that there is anything about the mind that BS does not know .
In fact , the mode of access argument is ambiguous .
If what I said above is correct , failure of the mode of access argument forces the materialist to deny that BS lacks any knowledge and to adopt a behaviourist theory .
This is a spurious argument .
Reflection on the nature of the argument against behaviourism in general , however , reveals that the argument refutes the behaviourist treatment of perception in particular .
This may look like an easy knock-down argument against a silly theory which nobody has ever seriously held .
Well , I think that there is an argument of sorts for saying that a computer of the kind described does not have a theory of the external world , does not have mental states which refer , and does not therefore have thoughts in any significant sense .
How about a more modest version of the argument which says that only certain primitive concepts are innate , and that the more sophisticated concepts develop out of these through the time - honoured processes of differentiating finer concepts from global ones and integrating the results into complex , structured concepts .
recall the Fodor 's argument against learning .
It will rely upon an argument from Kant .
Coda We have covered a lot of ground , and maybe the path through the undergrowth of arguments and data is not a very straight or a very clear one .

First , there is the dualist 's argument that mental processes can not be physical processes because physical entities such as neurons-lack certain qualities such as intentionality or consciousness that characterize the mental .
and see Dennett , 1988 , for some powerful arguments that it is not .
Successful Science The sceptic might , at this point , complain that while I may have sketched out the functionalist position , I have not provided any convincing arguments as to why one should believe it .
And although the majority of materialist philosophers base their belief in the neurophysiological theory of perception on arguments rather than observations , they are , nevertheless , greatly influenced by the apparent successes of neurophysiology .
A further telling argument against the dual aspect theory-and one that has been rarely noticed is that aspects are relative to viewpoints ; in other words , they emerge posterior to perceptions .
However , it is necessary to say a word or two here to refute this seemingly compelling argument .
Afterwards somehow an argument started .
Their argument is that it is good for the tournament , a s well as the players concerned , if as many as possible of the higher ranked competitors survive the early rounds .
Jim Coates Executive Director The British Schools LTA The conflicts within British tennis As Wimbledon again approaches , the arguments about why British tennis is so poor still rage on , and are getting even more heated .
The government accepted the argument , and approved the investment .
The government accepted the argument , and approved the investment .
And David Gardner 's defence of processed hops does remind the listener powerfully of the arguments advanced by the brewers in the 1960s when they were replacing cask ale with keg beer .
It should come as no surprise then , that some of those who see bolting as fundamentally reducing the experience I have outlined above , and which is our common heritage , should cast around for some solid arguments to counter its spread .
Controversy and argument attract notoriety .
And as for damage to an historic monument , to wit Dumbarton Rock , and the subject of the piece in The Observer , the photograph that appeared alongside it gives the lie to this self-generated argument .
Let the argument rage about the ethics of bolting .
While acknowledging his argument for the bolt placement , I advised that he had done the route ; if others thought a bolt should be placed , let someone else go ahead and place it .
This statement can defend both sides of the argument .
As for the other matter , it sounds like your dog could have earned his scabs by either defending himself , or having an argument with a cat .
This distinction should be preserved , since it belongs to the novel 's overall against-logic argument .
As with the censored Christian argument in Notes from Underground , I believe an unfathomable good luck wearing the face of bad luck was on his side at the start .
This argument just does not hold water .
Look at the arguments .

It uses post fix notation , where arguments come first and operators follow .
It acknowledges that the following texts and their arguments are difficult , but the difficulty is not to be hidden we ourselves have no right to hide it .

He takes poststructuralist assumptions about the death of the author and the disappearance of the self-subsistent ego , and applies them to the history of English poetry , in a work which combines ingenious close reading , impressive knowledge of metre , and an overall argument of stratospheric thinness and remoteness .
The use of names rather than arguments as ammunition has become noticeable in such exercises , on both sides of the Atlantic , as Chris Baldick remarks in a review of Frederick Crews 's Skeptical Engagements .
One lamentable practice which Crews rightly scorns is the increasingly revived trick or medieval rhetoric in which one attempts to substantiate one 's theoretical argument not by anything so vulgarly empirical as a fact or a text but merely by invoking a name from the sacred pantheon .
Tallis 's case is convincing , though he has certainly not said the last word on the matter , and there may well be further arguments from those who are professionally engaged in linguistics .
Scholes , however , believes that Saussure is himself inconsistent , and responsible for later confusion , but the thrust of his argument is very close to Tallis 's , and both of them are concerned as were Thurley and Nuttall to reinstate the validity of reference and to deny that language is a system of pure differences , without relation to reality .

This is an interestingly eclectic argument which recalls Gadamer on the fusion of horizons , Marcuse on the utopian possibilities of high culture , and Sartre on the necessarily progressive implications of major literature .

My feelings about the book were positive rather than the reverse , but I complained in my review that it was studded with references to fashionable French gurus that were purely cosmetic , adding nothing to the author 's argument .

The latter presentation is not so common , because of the generally unfavourable associations of aesthetic in our culture , though it is implied whenever students are asked to approach a poem as a work of art , rather than as an historical document or a philosophical argument .
These would include the arguments of the major poet-critics of the past .
Victoria Glendinning , writing as a biographer and literary journalist , has offered some judicious thoughts on the question , which summarize much of my argument .
Eliot borrowed from it for The Waste Land , thus making it permanently famous ; Pound could not have known of it in 1911 , but if he had then visited the Templars ' cavern-church in Aubeterre he could hardly have failed to remember it in the light of jessie Weston 's argument .
All the same Schneidau 's argument is just and illuminating , so far as it goes .
Both men are reporting what seem to them the facts of the case , and they are the more confident about doing so because no Englishman has arisen to rebut their arguments .
But the main thrust of Olson 's argument is unaffected , and it ca n't be set aside .
The justification of Mr Pound 's thesis in How To Read is not his arguments , but his poetry .
Thus some slow , desiccated waltzing and gentle leans have the quietude of an old couple on a dull mild day ; sequences of deft , steppy footwork and sharp edged leaps have the high spirits of blustery sunshine , while a duet of rhythmic fidgety gestures has the feel of a lifelong argument continued during a rainy afternoon .

If so his argument goes consenting adults in the private sectors of different countries lend money to each other , all that shows is that capital markets are usefully redirecting the surplus savings of one economy to the investment opportunities in another .
Evidence of excessive demand There is some observable good sense in this argument , and it helps to explain why sterling has not hit the fan a lot earlier , during a truly spectacular swing from surplus to deficit over the past two years .

Mr Cook also countered the argument that PR would build in a pull towards the centre ground , preventing Labour from implementing a radical programme .
Their argument was that a male 's potential quality as a parent might be important because , in many species of Old World monkeys , males form strong protective relationships with females and their young , which are crucial in reducing the amount of harassment and competition the young suffer from other members of the group .
Now it is quite right of them , of course , to allow our social obligations not to be forgotten ; there 'll probably be an argument .
If it did not exist , would anyone trouble to invent it at a time when , from the Atlantic to the Urals , socialism in all its manifestations is losing the argument to liberal capitalism .
This a very English and pragmatic argument for the necessity of a central authority in the Church .
The crux of our argument is that we do n't need to have toxic wastes and the fact that plants like Rechem exist , providing easy options for companies , is acting as a disincentive for companies to clean up .
So a part of the argument switches to the kind of incinerators you allow while industry is forced to clean itself up .
But , particularly since Tiananmen , it has been echoing the argument that people would be less concerned to leave Hong Kong before 1997 if they could be absolutely confident that other countries would accept them after that date .
To those who see China in primarily economic terms , the golden goose argument comes most easily .
He has been one of the Legislative Council 's most diligent members , a demanding enough job ; he accepted China 's offer of a seat on the Basic Law Drafting Committee , helping to write Hong Kong 's post-1997 mini-constitution , and was embroiled in more unsuccessful arguments for direct elections , opposed by mainland communists and Hong Kong conservatives .

Crossman tended to presume that all those he came across , at work or socially , liked nothing better than to have their intellectual sacred cows challenged , their arguments questioned and their assumptions subjected to loud investigation .

However if this way of jumping from two feet to two feet had not been combined with well picked-up pas de bourre piqus and relevs retirs as well as extremely accurate , quick ports de bras with straighter and more angled than rounded arms , they would have seemed out of place .

His Firebird flew and still flies in all her glory before being trapped pitifully in the arms of the Tsarevich .
But the latter 's pause was often to hold the dancers in perfect 5th positions of both arms and feet .
The tone is set by the continual use of the pose with head held high , back slightly arched , arms in closed 4th or a stretch fully upwards in 5th sur les pointes for Kitri or on demi - pointes for Basil .

Ashton 's careful build-up to this climax makes Vera 's discovery of them in each other 's arms all the more poignant because she shows a child-like petulance at losing one she so longed to have for her own .
It is no longer the case that the romantic style means dancing classically from the feet to the waist and above that allowing the body , arms and head to express themselves to describe the moods , emotions and actions of the characters .
Continual development in the choreographic design is very obvious in the quiver of the raised leg as the Tutor takes Natalia in his arms .
From there onwards it becomes stronger and more emotional so that her joyous movements and later abandon in Romeo 's arms are in absolute contrast to her later dance with Paris .
These rules give the directions into which the head , body and arms should move when expressing certain moods , emotions and actions .
1 Upwards and outwards The head , body and arms rise upwards and outwards in all the happy emotions as can be seen in the final dances of The Sleeping Beauty , La Fille Mal Garde and Daphnis and Chlo .

Choreographers have never disdained to use popular music for their everincreasing audiences and they realise that they should reflect popular taste .
Choreographers have never disdained to use popular music for their everincreasing audiences and they realise that they should reflect popular taste .
Despite strict rhythm and exact phrasing , the music was daringly frivolous in tone and quality because it was meant to entertain a popular audience .
It was the ideas behind this design that so interested not only the audience but also the music critics of the time .
But if it is repeated too often the incessant jigging of hands makes the audience restless , too .
There remain , however , a few dancers who excel in the purely classical roles , which an audience demands because they are still testing grounds for particular talents .
The rules are still valid and the libretto of any ballet neglecting them often fails to hold the attention of its audience because the content has been weakened by too many irrelevances .
A choreographer who neglects the old rules and any item pertinent to the unfolding of the plot , theme or music is demanding a great deal from an audience .
These musical phrases give continuity to the action and are most valuable because they help both performers and audience to understand how moments in the story or theme affect the players .
There is always a moment of silence before the audience respond , so strong has been the tension .
They also opened the eyes of the audience to the endless possibilities of expressing meaning through dance .
The choreographer seizes on the personality of a particular dancer and creates ballets through which the dancer gradually develops and discloses unique talent and qualities to such a degree that audiences soon recognise a star .

Perhaps no ballet has ever made the same impact on dancers and audience as Stravinsky 's Rite of Spring .
Perhaps no ballet has ever made the same impact on dancers and audience as Stravinsky 's Rite of Spring .
Its urgent overall rhythm commands the choreographer to keep the dancers moving forever onwards with greater intensity to the climax , whilst the shorter phrase rhythms give the Chosen Maiden and smaller groups such ways of moving that they hold the audience 's full attention until the fall of the curtain .
Although this is of considerable importance , particularly if the ballet is to be presented in a large theatre , too much concentration on certain of the dimensions may deprive some members of the audience of much of the pattern .
However , choreographers should always remember that whatever story , theme or music is chosen , it must be translated into clear , often simple , dance statements understandable by an audience .
Choreographers should never assume that all in the audience have sufficient knowledge of the subject , theme and ideas which are possibly understood only by an exclusive coterie of friends .
Similarly the delicate and subtle nuances of such ballets as Ashton 's A Month in the Country , Robbins ' Dances at a Gathering and MacMillan 's Song of the Earth are successfully conveyed and capture the audience 's attention from the moment the curtain rises by the impetus , rhythm , dimension and variety of dance .
On the other hand , Prokofiev used his overture to Romeo and Juliet to introduce the leitmotifs which will help both dancers and audience to follow the unfolding of the plot .
Even with such examples in mind the choreographer may well decide it is better to delay the confrontation between the chief players because , by creating and stressing the general atmosphere , this raises the audience 's expectations before the meeting of the protagonists , and the sudden onset of passion is what makes the ultimate tragedy so poignant .
This last task is possibly the most difficult because the audience must be convinced that the ending chosen is the only possible outcome of everything that has gone before .
This last task is possibly the most difficult because the audience must be convinced that the ending chosen is the only possible outcome of everything that has gone before .
Texture Arrangement of threads ; the characteristic feel or look of this arrangement This definition should be understood as the choreographer 's ability to establish a style of movement through which the audience will feel and understand what the performers are communicating through a particular way of dancing .
In addition to the courtesy the partners show to each other , there are also the courtesies that must be shown to the bystanders on stage during a pas de deux so that such reciprocation can help to focus the audience 's attention on the context of the dance .
It is possibly the spaciousness of design that brings audiences again and again to Ashton 's Symphonic Variations and Monotones , whose straighter and continuously moving lines require the dancers to draw them calmly and to fill the stage generously with movement .
the swift change from the grand dvelopp la seconde which Odile makes facing the audience and her sudden turn to arabesque when she looks straight into the kneeling Siegfried 's eyes in the Act II pas de deux of Swan Lake ; it is Odile 's triumph for she knows she has won Siegfried 's heart .
each soloist need not begin with a formal bow to a king or to the audience , nor end with another bow or considered pose ; but such behaviour may be included if the choreographer wishes to locate dance in a particular century and probably a palace in which the story unfolds .
Many new members of an audience have been known to object to the applause greeting the last bow .
Another old rule decreed that dancers never turned their backs on the audience , because all had to face the king , the centre of attention .
In fact such unusual movements often arouse the audience to gentle laughter as swift changes add a touch of humour as two or more dancers compete to capture the attention of both the audience and their Colleagues .
The dancers now appeared on a stage before a wide audience and the focus of their attention changed to the whole audience or to the most important performers .

In these the expert gestures and extemporised playing of easily recognised characters in certain stock situations were understood by audiences everywhere no matter what the native language because the gestures were so explicit .

But audiences sitting and watching can only join in the fun in their imagination and if the dancers are sufficiently out-going .
The movements were strongly influenced by the stylised Bugako players and were appropriate to each scene , but oddly enough the whole appeared too static , as if a series of japanese prints was being paraded before the audience .
Those in the audience who have had to suffer such behaviour in a concert hall , whilst trying to listen to a brilliant musician , know that his remarks about certain characters are only too true .
His two tiny gestures said everything and expressed the audience 's understanding of the plot .
He made one as if he should try and comfort her , but turned away , walked upstage and on the balcony with his back to the audience , raised his arms widely only to drop them helplessly .
When this happened , however , even the traditional features became more stereotyped because choreographers used only those which the audience could easily recognise and which were commonly seen and heard in a particular country .
3 In order to display particular native features , the traditional circle , chain and couple dance formations must be broken up and opened outwards so that the steps are seen clearly by the audience .
Without him there is no other character with whom the audience can feel sympathy .
When he pulls himself up or corrects his placing or step he beams on the audience as , for example , when he finishes with his back after a pirouette and hastily turns to face them .
Man 's inhumanity to Man The Burrow ; A Distant Drummer It is important to note that these ballets were created by MacMillan whose aim has been to convince audiences that dance in ballet belongs to the reality of life and to show how life can be manipulated .
They really lived , were visualised by the composer , then the choreographer and recognised by old friends in the audience .

It is designed to display both dancer and dance to the best advantage from the audience 's point of view .
If they do they have forgotten that , like them , every member of their audience has an inborn sense of measuring time .
By so phrasing each paragraph and bringing each incident to a proper conclusion , Nijinska gives both dancers and audience time to consider what has been done and what is yet to happen .
Nijinska insisted on the use of the pointes in order to emphasise the elongated portraits of the Byzantine Saints , thus the dancers ' bodies mostly face the audience but their arms and legs turn inwards and are seen mostly in profile .
The audience recognise physical movement for itself alone whereas those who theorise and attempt to define what they mean by such terms as post or neo - modern , contemporary , avant - garde , etc .
Thus the audience fail to understand everything that is offered .
Proposals should have to be advertised locally , the manifesto says , and customers should be given a right of audience before the licensing authorities to oppose unwelcome changes .

Wired purports to be about America not just Belushi , but this is trite stuff about decadence in Tinseltown ; what it has to say about the nation is nugatory , unless you count a depressing scene in which an audience collapses in laughter while the Voice of its Generation stuffs a sandwich down his pants .

By not uttering a word to the audience , then keeping the stage shrouded in smoke , lit only from the back in lurid purple , orange and red , and reducing the band to shadowy figures looming out of a fog , he put so much distance between them and anybody past the regulation of-stage pogoers that attention easily wandered .
Over the years , Page has established himself as a medieval raconteur , delighting his audience with tales of , say , thirteenth-century Paris ; but anecdotes aside , he has also been refining the presentation and programming so that , almost without realising it , his audiences learn a good deal about the often totally unfamiliar music being performed .

A few seconds later as the aircraft gains more speed , it will need more forward movement to prevent it from unsticking with the tail-wheel or skid touching the ground , and climbing away too steeply .
If the speed is too low , the pilot reduces the climbing angle and the driver , seeing the reduction in load , applies more power .
If the speed is too low , the pilot reduces the climbing angle and the driver , seeing the reduction in load , applies more power .
In windy conditions , the glider will climb higher if the launching speeds are on the slow side , whereas on a calm day the best speed is closer to the limit shown on the placard .

On a normal tow , except for very low performance machines , the climbing angle of the towplane and glider is much steeper than the glider 's gliding angle when flying downwind .

The tow pilot can help by allowing his aircraft to climb away , gaining speed rather than holding it down close to the ground .
The student can be asked to pitch nose-down gently from level flight and from diving and climbing attitudes .

To save or transfer drawings made on cad systems ; To save or transfer images from computer art systems , scanners , or acquired from a camera ; To control advanced printers ; .
A high-level approach , sometimes referred to as a drawing description or vector file , or meta file ; A low-level approach based upon the pixel information used to display a digital image , sometimes referred to as bit mapped , raster based , or image file .
For this type of picture the bit image file comes into its own .
In some cases a bit image is little more than a memory dump of video ram .
Bit image files normally have a fixed format header giving general information about the file and its format .
This low level pixel oriented approach obviously makes sense for complex images with no formal structure , such as budgerigars .
Run Length Limitation is probably the most common for bit image files , although the LZW algorithm is also in use .
While a cad transfer file can describe objects with the accuracy of floating point numbers , a bit image file is restricted to a digitising process .
Far from being device neutral , the image file is usually coded in a way which reflects the device which first produced it .
At first sight the obvious answer might be to convert all images to some enormously high resolution which would satisfy any possible requirement .
, write a bit image file in terms of the resolution available at the time it is created .
If the new resolution is greater than the original , you can show your entire image at its original resolution in part of your new display device , ie .
In any case , keep the original bit image file .
Remember that any compressed or expanded version of a bit image will contain distortions of the original , however , intelligent the algorithms used .
Examples of bit image file formats are .
The PCX format starts with a 128 byte header giving various general details , including bits/pixel , the number of bit planes , and the size of the image in pixels .
The header information includes the physical size of each pixel , in microns , thus linking the image firmly to its original representation .
This was developed by the Aldus Corporation and Microsoft particularly for images obtaining from scanning devices , and is widely used in desk top publishing .
The format has a tree like structure which provides more flexibility than most bit image files , and a powerful range of alternative compression methods .
Other bit image formats are GIF , which uses LZW compression and is widely used for clip art ; PIC , which is used by the Halo screen art programme ; and CUT , which uses the enhanced small disk drive RLL compression algorithm .
Similarly , if a 16 colour bit image file format refers to red , green , blue and intensity planes , this will only be true of the default palette settings .
Most printers are monochrome , but the often have a higher resolution than bit image date .
Before printing a page , the printer 's processor assembles a complete bit mapped image into its memory .
Those stored in high level form are called outline or stroked fonts , and scale much more gracefully than bit image fonts , particularly to large sizes .
A pixel addressable printer can obviously reproduce a bit mapped image , and page description formats have developed to allow this .
A special escape sequence defines a rectangular area of the page and then introduces a block of pixel data , very similar in principle to a bit image file .
Such a bit image blocks are not normally compressed , and anyone using graphics in a document is familiar with the time it takes to load the printer .
It is largely based on the bit image approach , and assumes a resolution of around 100 pixels per inch , which could become a limitation in the future .

Religion The Roman catholic church retained a unified hierarchical organization for the whole of the island with its bishops meeting periodically at Maynooth .
This is the arrangement in Holland whereby various institutions such as media , schools , cultural organizations , welfare services , and hospitals are duplicated , and run by the separate catholic and protestant communities .
It also set up its own scouting organizations , clubs both sporting and social , with Irish music , Irish dancing , and Irish or Gaelic games .
It is important to note that these organizations are internally stratified .
The labour movement in Ireland was made up of two organizations .
The bulk of its organizers were members of traditional organizations of the old sodality type .
members from the Legion of Mary , the Knights of Columbanus , and one or two other organizations of more recent origin devoted to the strengthening of catholic morality .
The organization claimed membership from all parts of the South , and its membership contained education specialists , lawyers , people from the media , and civil servants , at least one of whom knew something of the existing channels of power and communication between church and state in the national school system .
In 1978 , on the basis of their professional knowledge of schooling and civil administration , the organization succeeded in obtaining the necessary government permission to open in Dalkey a multi-denominational school governed principally by the parents , the mode of religious instruction to be determined by them .
His words were taken up by many who would not have dreamed of opening any of his more technical works , and he came to be in great demand as a speaker at rallies and at the numerous conferences and seminars on the death of images organized by the Universities , the Churches and the innumerable Humanist organizations which had mushroomed in the immediately preceding decades .
My job was to operate the telephone switchboard , sort the morning post , direct house-callers to the appropriate organization , and that was about it .
ANTHROPOLOGY FOR THE POLICE It seems relevant that anthropology be used at this time to contribute to the debate on policing , for since the 1964 Police Act and the preceding Royal Commission which was generated through concern over police practice , the organization has held an increasingly central place in the public imagination .
there is simply no room in the management and organization of police operations for vague , academic dissertations .
Usually policemen know the limits allowed by the organization and play safe .
In consequence of this acquired system of generative schemes , an imbued belief is implanted in the institutional mind which verges on the natural , while Huxley 's mutilated man pursuing his insider 's reflexivity seeks out the lateral possibility , and makes gestures against the principles of the organization .
Formal control , however , is only one aspect of the labour process in any work organization .
The nation-wide state publishing organization , Gosizdat , was responsible for the dissemination of official literature of all kinds , but the flow of materials to the provinces remained very weak even as late as 1923 .
Given the importance of this area of Russia in the Civil War and the Polish campaign , the Party 's care for and vigilance over the army does not come as a surprise ; nor does the considerable military presence in 1922 in civilian organizations like the hospital and the automobile workshop .
A shef organization from the towns such as an individual factory would take on the role of cultural and political mentor to some rural group .
The party 's myopic concentration on the kind of agricultural organizations it wished to nurture for the future is also shown in the frequent reports for 1922 on the fragile co-operative network .
Right from its inception NEP carried within itself the germs of its own fatal illness , whether one looks at its fiscal organization or the economic persona which it soon evoked , or in many cases re-awakened .
His opinion of the local Komsomol was no doubt coloured by the fact that his own colony was a kind of rival organization , but his view broadly reflects that of Yakovlev on the Nikol ` skaia Komsomol ; Yakovlev was a more disinterested outsider .
Makarenko , succeeded in forming a genuine Soviet collective of charges only after a Komsomol organization was established in his colony .
Nansen , the esteemed Norwegian co - ordinator of many other foreign relief organizations , could on occasion be carried away by his emotions and give a semi-fictional account of conditions in the Volga provinces .
As the Famine grew , poor co-operation between the Soviet authorities and foreign relief groups , and amongst the foreign organizations themselves , exacerbated the situation .
Soviet and foreign relief organizations had installed themselves with efficiency and were giving out free food .
Those peasants who continued to own draught animals had lent them to relief organizations at the height of the Famine , but by the spring of 1922 they refused to do this any longer , since they now found many profitable uses for them .
Party , Soviet , co-operative , military , educational , and trade-union organizations were involved .
At both guberniia and central levels the Soviet government established a liaison system between their own plenipotentiaries and all foreign relief organizations .
Since all foreign relief organizations dealt with Pomgol and with Eiduk as chief plenipotentiary , subsequent non-Russian scholars have tended to over-concentrate on the workings of Pomgol and its guberniia equivalents .
Foreign relief organizations and subsequent students of their work have tended to exaggerate this dichotomy with regard to the Famine , but internal Soviet sources lend credence to the view that the sudden withdrawal of many kinds of domestic relief was premature .
When in September 1922 the ARA discovered that the Soviet government intended to export grain in considerable quantities , most foreign relief organizations joined in the hue and cry .
We know from the Smolensk archive that the guberniia committee in the winter of 19223 convened meetings of many local organizations , compelling their members to subscribe to various Belorussian and Great-Russian newspapers .
Especially disadvantaged were children , whose needs were dramatically highlighted by the Child Poverty Action Group and similar organizations .
Suggestions in 1975 of a military coup by Colonel Stirling 's non-party , non-class organization of apprehensive patriots or General Walker 's non-class Militia met with almost universal derision .
The meeting at Evanston clinched the sense of scepticism which Ramsey felt , not about the ecumenical movement , but about its inflated claims and its mode of organization .
Such a religious patterning of small communities reveals a Christendom fixed at the state of development suitable to a simple agricultural and piscatorial society , and so imperfectly suited to the more complicated organization of modern society .
Here he finds organizations like the Liberty and property Defence League and The British Constitutional Association , and individuals like Lord Wemyss , Herbert Spencer , A .
In terms of the history of these organizations as institutions Coetzee 's work is unlikely to be surpassed .
but with regard to the broader historical significance of these organizations he is less assured , and he leaves untouched some of the more important questions raised by his work .
The rival , splinter organization which emerged as a result , the Imperial Maritime League , claimed that any serious Navalist had to support the Conservatives , irrespective of the fact that individual Liberal candidates were sound on naval questions , on the grounds that collectively the Liberals were against and the Conservatives in favour of a big Navy .
It is one of the many strengths of Coetzee 's work that he recognizes the disruptive potential of the new organizations , but he concludes that ultimately they were of benefit to the Conservatives .
Only gradually did it dawn on those responsible that vigorous and determined nationalist organizations had grown up in the shadow of the Japanese , that these movements had flourished exceedingly in the vacuum left by the collapse of Japanese power , and that if the colonial regimes were to be reconstituted it could only be by force .
Even South Africa may decide that the returns from supporting such organizations as Renamo in Mozambique are extremely slim .
The first task consisted of formulating a view of society which was based on principles different from the traditional ones , according to which societies could be typified in terms of their administrative organization by using such terms as democracy or monarchy .
In order to bypass this traditional way of seeing society , Marx turned away from administrative and political organization and tried to see society in different , more fundamental terms .
At first the freemen of both town and country had an organization and a type of property which still retained something of the communal as well as something of the private , but in the town a radical transformation was taking place .
The third part of Engels 's discussion explains why , in spite of the presence of the State in medieval Europe , some islands of communal organization could and did remain .
In this way Engels asserts the generality of the principles discussed , but also he explains the importance of what he believed were remains of gentile principles in the organization of Greece and Rome .
The first is that it shows well the distinction Engels makes between general principles in this case the dissolution of communal organization and the rise of class and specific cases .
None the less the fact remains that the presence of descent groups tells us nothing directly about domestic organization .
Morgan believed that the only true descent groups were matrilineal , and that matrilineal descent groups gens were fundamentally different in organization from systems where descent was reckoned in the male line .
What matters , as Morgan , Marx , and Engels rightly stress , is the corporate organization of descent groups , but these descent groups are just as corporate whether descent is reckoned patrilineally or matrilineally .
On the whole , however , their ideas concerning the political organization of descent-group society , what they call the gentile constitution , are surprisingly modern and helpful and seem supported by more recent findings .
This had been one of the 150 organizations that had written asking for patronage when Diana became engaged , and had been turned down .

Euro - elections were pending and , it was rumoured , he was doing his best to make life miserable for an organization which challenged his claim to the green constituency .
A great many green ideas were produced by Labour that summer ; a green bill to show up the deficiencies in Tory legislation ; making the quality of life the central theme in the 1990 local elections ; the mobilization of public opinion through the development of a network of environmental , countryside and energy organizations .
Many waverers must have reached for their chequebooks and signed on with a green campaign organization after hearing the latest pronouncement assuring them that there really was something to worry about .
That certainly applies to the three biggest international green campaign organizations .
What is true is that , in recent years , such actions have been backed up by sophisticated political lobbying and scientific enquiry that have added strength to the organization 's dramatic calls for change .
The choice of heads for the campaigning organizations says a great deal about their memberships .
It bills itself as the largest private conservation organization in the world , with offices in twenty-three countries and more than one million members .
Like the other campaign organizations , WWF had realized that the natural world can no longer be divided into isolated sectors of activity .
There is an obvious danger of excessive duplication when broadly similar organizations conduct broadly similar campaigns .
Ad hoc alliances of green organizations take place from time to time , and at the end of 1988 Greenpeace , Friends of the Earth and the World Wide Fund for Nature jointly threw down a green gauntlet to the government , urging it to turn propaganda about the environment into action .

In February 1983 I announced in the House of Commons that health authorities should put their ancillary services out to tender to see whether they would get best value from private or in-house organizations .
Mrs Shakespeare , you are well-known for your investigations into extreme left-wing groups and terrorist organizations .
Soloway 's comment that , The birth control groups found it difficult to persuade the middle and upper-class membership of the feminist organizations that access to the contraceptive methods was a genuine problem , seems both ill-founded and unnecessary .
And practically nothing has been done to establish effective machinery of joint conference between the representative organizations entitled to speak for industry as a whole .
To him , however , the overriding developments were the increasing centralization of party organization and the growing predominance of the unions .
It was not until the 1930s that a more effective fascist organization , the British Union of Fascists , was formed under the leadership of Oswald Mosley , at a time when Britain was attempting to deal with the unemployment of between 20 and 23 per cent .
Quite rightly , the Labour Party did not wish to exaggerate the importance of a fringe political group which it had investigated in a detailed national survey , based upon a circular to the secretaries of its constituency organizations in 1934 .
The campaign was in defiance of the Labour Party ban on joint work with the Communists and the Socialist League was condemned by the party , its members being forced to choose between disbanding the organization of expulsion .

The result was periodic clashes between the government and organizations such as Protestant Action which insisted on the right to march where they wished .
The rudiments of a constituency organization were then provided .
Others maintained that , even if he knew nothing of these crimes , he was morally responsible in that he had contributed substantially to the general climate which allowed members of his organization to believe that such acts were justified in order to destabilize the government of Terence O'Neill .
In many areas , it took the full weight of Paisley 's authority , exercised either directly or through loyal supporters such as Gordon Cooke , then chairman of the North Antrim branch , to persuade the Protestant Unionists to dissolve in favour of the new organization .
At a number of times since , there has been a genuine willingness among some of the DUP members of the United Ulster Unionist Coalition to merge their party into a new wider organization .
Although Robinson and others were achieving success in building a province-wide organization , the DUP 's greatest asset was its leader .
This does not mean that Paisley would not be glad of the support of individual Catholics , but he would not work with Catholic organizations or officials of the Catholic Church because that might dilute his separatist witness .
As the main churches have become more liberal , Free Presbyterianism emerged to challenge the lack of real Protestantism and hence offered an implicit challenge to the fraternal organizations to purify themselves by breaking their ties with the main , and now apostate , denominations .
Of forty-four ministers whose affiliations are known , twenty-one have never been members of any fraternal organization .
It would be easy to exaggerate the extent to which the lack of genuine evangelicalism in the fraternal organizations creates motivational problems for Free Presbyterians who wish to be active in politics .
It is usually the case that those things which best suit the Michels model are social movement organizations which have goals which can be compromised because they are things like an increase in workers ' standards of living or an improvement in working conditions which are divisible .

During this period I have given readings and seminar papers at various academic centres , including the universities of Oxford , Durham , Edinburgh , Essex , Manchester , Lancaster , Newcastle , Sussex , and East Anglia , and have written a number of unpublished papers which I have given in seminars at other similar establishments .
As a result of this all pervading desire for reticence it is possible to suggest that the presentation of research papers in seminars , the creation of an undirected thesis , not to mention the production of a book , could easily have placed me in breach of Regulation 6 , which outlines the disciplinary offence of Improper disclosure of information , which offence is committed where a member of a police force without proper authority communicates to any person , any information which he has in his possession as a member of a police force That I avoided such a course of action is because of my own understanding of what the institution would allow before it swung into action .

The party structure followed was based on the Irish civil war antagonism of 19223 , with the pro-Treaty party more or less in power until the anti-Treaty party entered politics in 1930 .
However , both sides developed a centralized party organization , with politicians following the party line .
Despite the official socialist tendencies of these two parties , a substantial number of their voters do not appear to question the maintenance of a capitalist-type class structure in a new Ireland .
The SDLP , still the main party of catholic nationalists in Ulster , has dropped much of its socialist platform and maintains a delicate balance between nationalism and pragmatism in its politics .
Yet , despite the splintering , they have succeeded in allying the present two main parties against the Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985 .

The emergence of a new pro-capitalist party in the South from the end of 1985 , the Progressive Democratic Party , might show the extent to which political divisions based on the treaty and within the nationalist component of hegemony may have become problematic , to be partially replaced by an even more explicit concern with increasing the popular wealth and prosperity .
Because the nation is seen as only partially liberated , and particularly by the membership of the largest party Fianna Fil , the animus of the national-popular consciousness is focused on this issue , to the detriment of class-based politics .
The collections indicated a wider hidden culture of support for the lads who were at the forefront of the battle to restore national unity , in addition to the much smaller party political support they enjoyed in the South .

The latter point was silly , coming from a man who has spent much of the last five years persuading his party that the world had changed since May 1979 and that there was no going back .
But it would be hard to argue , say , that Greeks are less moral because of the appalling corruption of and greed demonstrated by senior figures in the government and party of the socialist Andreas Papandreou .
Wilson 's task was to project his party as an alternative government and associate Labour with the agenda of the 1960s .
Mr Kinnock 's job at conference must be to demonstrate Labour 's electability by confirming the party 's new revisionism , by reassuring voters on issues where there is still doubt and , above all , by helping set the agenda for the 1990s .
The party has abandoned policies which made it unelectable in the 1980s .
It is no longer the party of traditional nationalisation ; it is no longer anti-European ; above all , it is no longer unilateralist .
Polls show that , despite impressive performances by John Smith and Gordon Brown , many voters still believe Labour is a party of high taxation and inflation .
The party has to emphasise that , in contrast to the Tories , it believes public spending should rise in line with growth in output , but that it will pursue responsible fiscal policies .
He should repeat his assurance that , while Labour is opposed to the privatisation of water and electricity and wants to see a return to public control , it is not the party 's intention to clobber those who buy shares .
It must be Mr Kinnock 's task this week to capture this new agenda for Labour and set the party on the path to power .
For as Mao decreed , if power grows from the barrel of a gun , it is the party that must control , and if necessary use , that gun .
The party may claim to be in the vanguard of history , but its clock seems to have stopped in the 1950s .

Party organisers want the conference to show that the party is united as never before , leaving Mr Kinnock free for the first time to sell the policy package to voters without worrying about splits .
It is also possible that party members in Barnsley would prefer a more moderate candidate .
Maybe it was for that reason that the party leader singled Mr Prescott 's past year performance out for praise in an interview in The Sunday Correspondent yesterday , calling him , chummily , Johnny .
Conference condemned by activists as farce By STEPHEN GOODWIN AN ATTEMPT by party activists to empower the Labour conference to amend the leadership 's policy review was defeated with the aid of union block votes .
But Larry Whitty , general secretary , said under party rules policy statements , such as the manifesto , were not amendable .
Moving it , Ken Slater , of Hyndburn , pointed out there were some 60 resolutions on the conference agenda endorsing existing party policy for unilateral nuclear disarmament .
Florrie North , of Eltham , said , after 53 years as a party member , that it seems conference is being asked to rubber stamp policies made elsewhere .
A hardline motion calling for black sections is almost certain to be thrown out on Friday and the party could be left without a policy as support for a proposition calling for societies with exclusively black members is also in doubt .
John Edmonds , a confidant of Neil Kinnock , said the party needed to talk to potential members rather than rely on advertisements and mail shots .
Left rejects appeals for unity By JOHN PIENAAR PROMINENT left-wingers yesterday rebuffed appeals for unity behind Labour 's policy review and accused the party leadership of a calculated effort to stifle grassroot dissent .
Now we have a leadership that claims the right to control the party entirely from the top .
He cited the decision to deny local activists the chance to amend the review , the leadership 's refusal to restore all trade union immunities , the rejection of demands for all-black sections within the party and the strengthening of Shadow Cabinet power .
The whole balance of the party is being moved away from the conference and the NEC to the Shadow Cabinet .
He also urged the party not to turn its back on traditional principles and values in its drive to agree an election-winning package of policies this week .
He maintained there was only one way to resolve differences within the party leadership over Labour 's policy towards a privatised water industry .
However , Mr Skinner firmly supported Neil Kinnock 's rejection of electoral pacts with other parties to help to defeat the Tories .
He portrayed the Tories as the party of worn-out ideas , led by a Cabinet of incompetents .
Though Dr Runcie and his party could not take Holy Communion at the papal mass , he had earlier celebrated the eucharist at the Anglican church in Rome after three demonstrators rose from the congregation as he ascended the pulpit ; the visit has been dogged by protests from supporters of the Rev Ian Paisley .
Ron Todd , the general secretary of the transport workers ' union , said that today 's vote on the multilaterist nuclear defence policy would not yield the massive and overwhelming majority predicted by right-wingers , and he warned that party leaders could not expect everybody to goose-step in the same direction once the policy had been carried .
Witchell would be doing his party trick only in special circumstances .
In six verbose years as leader of his party , Neil Kinnock has not a memorable phrase to his credit .
But that falls into the somewhat different category of intra - party polemic .
The party may have put on a collar and tie but it is still the Labour Party , prone to its old reflexes , prisoner still of its anachronistic structure , its mind set in 100 years of working-class history .
Here was the Labour Party reverting to its old self , a better self , yes , than the monster it became under the demonic spell of Tony Benn ; here was a party responsive once more to its own people , the people it so shamefully betrayed at two successive general elections since 1979 , but a party as somebody once said of the SDP - promising a better yesterday .
Amid the euphoria of its seven-point opinion poll lead , the party 's own pollsters have reminded it that in the South the Conservatives lead 47-33 while in the Midlands and Wales the race remains too close to call .
In a masterly television interview on Sunday , John Smith , the shadow Chancellor , exuded competence and an almost Gladstonian fiscal probity , but there was a ring of the Sixties about the accompanying discussion between MPs and experts which left the impression that , in squaring circles , the Labour Party remains endemically the party of inflation .
Yet if the GDR were to become a multi - party democracy , it would lose its identifying ideology and become a pallid shadow of the Federal Republic .
However , the watering down of a basic and principled commitment , within Labour or any other libertarian party , especially in response to intimidation by newspapers of such a spurious morality , could prove deeply discrediting .

Comrade Springer tries to liven up the party From ANNE APPLEBAUM in Lublin JUST because I was n't interned in 1981 does n't mean i am not a Polish patriot too , fumed a member of the Karczmiska Communist party committee .
We simply went to work like normal citizens during martial law and now it seems that 's a crime , he went on , gesturing at the 20 heads of party factory cells who were gathered to discuss the future of communism in Poland .
According to a recent Politburo dictum , the party will turn itself into a left-wing parliamentary party at its next congress early next year , and the Central Committee members were consulting local leaders about how to do it .
The most heated discussion revolved around the question of changing the party 's name .
If we change the name , we show disrespect for all of the good things the party has done for Poland .
The party must fight for its new image , not only for its own members , but also in front of the whole nation .
the party leader .
The Opole meeting was dominated by elderly party members , who refused to talk about such problems as names , new programmes , and new membership laws .
Mr Springer joined the party 25 years ago , and admitted that this era could be the most difficult he had ever lived through .
Successive state elections have seen the governing parties pummelled by a dismayed electorate .
The party reacted with unnecessary embarrassment and defensiveness to government attacks on general talks it has been holding with the Greens , and its desire , as part of its traditional Ostpolitik , to press on with contacts with the Communist party in East Berlin despite the sudden surge of open opposition to the government by East German citizens .
Two impressive victories this year , in Berlin and in Frankfurt , producing municipal coalitions with the Greens , were a fillip for party morale .
The change has been striking in two areas , with women 's issues and environmental concerns thrust to the head of the party agenda .
And the party has been devising an environmentally-friendly economic strategy .
The differences in our electorate are much bigger than for the conservative parties , says Heidi Wieczorek - Zeul , a member of the party praesidium .
The party leader , Hans - Jochen Vogel , a rather uninspiring figure , has nonetheless proved adept at managing this delicate evolution which , bolder than anything the Labour party ever contemplated , has avoided the sort of fratricidal bloodletting which ravaged its British counterpart .
But Mr Lafontaine , standard-bearer of the and-coming generation , and the second most important figure after Mr Vogel on the committee drafting the party programme for the next decade , has certainly not had things all his own way .
Whether the party likes it or not , its fortunes are hostage to the still youthful coalitions in Frankfurt and Berlin , and their notoriously unpredictable Green allies .
He quickly established himself within the PAN , challenging its professional politicians with the support of his business colleagues and unifying the fractious party .
Ultimately Clouthier 's campaign fell victim to the rise of the left and the governing party 's shift to the right .
It was for the party refusing to disclose to establish his right to refuse .
Policy review a symbol of party renewal By STEPHEN GOODWIN LABOUR 'S policy review was a symbol of the party renewing itself and becoming again a force for change , Tom Sawyer , deputy general secretary of Nupe , the public sector workers ' union , said at the start of four days of debate on the review reports .
Mr Sawyer , chairman of the party 's home policy committee which co-ordinated the work of the seven policy review groups , insisted there had been no sacrifice of principles .
Labour was moving on as a renewed party a party that cares as much about consumers as it cares about producers ; a party that wants to make the economy work as much as it wants to change the economy ; a party that embraces as much of the green as it does of the red .
The party leaders show no sign of relenting .
Anger as new defence policy is accepted By STEPHEN GOODWIN A UNILATERAL move by a Labour government to get rid of nuclear weapons could be reversed by a later administration , Gerald Kaufman , the party 's foreign affairs spokesman , argued yesterday as the Brighton conference swung behind a multilateral approach to disarmament .
I share the objective of all in our party who want a nuclear-free Britain .
The debate on the defence section of the party 's policy review report , Britain in the World , brought to a head the anger felt in sections of the party over Neil Kinnock 's shift away from unilateralism .
Sinn Fein president defends IRA 's barracks bomb attack By JOHN PIENAAR , Political Correspondent GERRY ADAMS last night discounted the anger and embarrassment of Labour leaders as he used a party conference fringe meeting to defend IRA terrorism , including the bomb attack on the Royal Marines at Deal , Kent .
The likeliest explanation of his defeat in the executive 's constituency section vote is that party activists wanted to rebuke him for publicly rocking the boat during the passage of the policy review .
Ken Livingstone 's problem is that he is always on the television slagging the party off .
The party leadership Neil Kinnock included could barely conceal their delight when the vote was declared .
Affirmed the party 's commitment to reduce defence spending initially to equal the average level of other West European countries and use savings for social spending .
Paterson leads NZ tour By BILL LOTHIAN DUNCAN PATERSON , the former international scrum-half from Gala , will manage a party of 30 Scotland players on the eight-match tour of New Zealand next May and June .
A party spokesman then suggested that it would be ignored , saying .
In the debate itself , some of the the-scenes tensions were reflected by party spokesmen attempting to discredit Mr Benn 's contribution , pointing out that he had served in Labour governments which maintained nuclear weapons .
it was an encouragement , an inspiration to see the party working together once more , he said .
This was the first year since he became leader of his party six years ago that Mr Kinnock was relieved of his preoccupation with an ungovernable party and was able to turn his attention properly to the government of the country .
Not badly at all , given the immense difficulty of restoring credibility to Labour as a party of government .
All elections in two - party parliamentary systems are essentially about whether or not it is time for a change .
What do fast cars and travel count for , the party 's youth organ asked , compared with the warmth of family , love , friendship , security and harmony .
He replied , the unity of the masses with the party was never so strong as now .
The people are behind the party .
The people are behind the party .
It is ridiculous that somebody should talk to a party and at the same time dictate to that party who should be heading it , he said in an interview with The Independent .
The ruling Pakistan Peoples Party was a prestigious party that was popular and they have let its prestige be ruined .
Among the celebrating parties , you could see those that were cheering for la France and de Gaulle , others for Stalin , others for el - Hussaini , but you could scarcely see any that were cheering for Lebanon .
Party members in Poland want change of name From ANNE APPLEBAUM in Warsaw WITH ITS power and prestige slipping away and its leaders calling desperately for unity , 72 per cent of Polish Communists have voted to find a new name for their party , the Polish United Workers ' Party .
Leaving behind their Stalinist-era organisation and programme , Poland 's Communists want to become a left-wing parliamentary party capable of winning elections .
In 1966 , however , when Mao began his dramatic bid for absolute power , using young Red Guards to discredit and persecute his old rivals within the party , Chen again rose to the occasion , acting as a mouthpiece for Mao 's increasingly scrambled thoughts and policies .
To this day the party has never quite healed the deep wounds left by what remains probably its most traumatic internal crisis .
The company had therefore been properly served with English proceedings by an American museum in Ohio , but since the Ohio court was the more appropriate forum for the trial of disputes between the parties , the English action would be stayed .
Executive votes show desire for unity By COLIN HUGHES , Political Correspondent THE BED-ROCK culture of the Labour Party is shifting towards an emphasis on loyalty and unity , according to an analysis of constituency party voting for Labour 's national executive .
Mr Livingstone argued that the move towards unity was merely the normal pre - election loyalty which the party usually showed ; the only difference this time was that it was happening 18 months earlier than normal .
The evidence showed , according to Mr Craven , that wherever individual party members were given the one member , one vote opportunity to voice their views , they rejected the hard left .
Its extension would now oblige the left to find new ways of campaigning among party members , because they tended to cast their votes according to what they saw on television .
His vote was more than halved in the party 's northern region , and nearly halved in both Yorkshire and the north-west .
Kinnock hails party as fit for government .
In his keynote speech , the Labour leader said it was an inspiration to see the party working together in support of its policy objectives .
The party was not only telling itself , but exuding to the British public the feeling that we are fit to serve our country , he said .
Labour would go on getting the public 's support by constructing strong unity of purpose and by its conduct as a serious , socialist , self-disciplined party , Mr Kinnock told delegates .
But it wo n't be good for the party .
We are losing votes by the bucketful because black people feel they are being abandoned by this party .
Many speakers highlighted the apparent paradox of a party which gave its blessing to separate internal organisations for both women and young people , but which denied the same privilege to its black members .
We have to recognise the strong feelings among black and white people that the party should not set up an organisation which is racially exclusive , and could be seen as a form of apartheid .
Ms Short , the Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood , gave the warning as the conference agreed to give women a higher profile in the party with a 40 per cent quota for women on all party committees and local party delegations .
Women share our values but we are seen by these women as male dominated and the most unsympathetic of all the parties .
Paths out of poverty defined by Smith By STEPHEN GOODWIN LABOUR delegates were warned yesterday that the party would lack electoral credibilty if it promised increases in public spending which could only be met by higher borrowing or taxes .
Around the Brighton Conference Centre , academic tracts on the party 's past and future course seem to proliferate daily .

In his address to the party conference at Brighton , Mr Kinnock said Labour was now ready , eager and able to take power from the Conservatives at the next election , and his confidence won him one of the most prolonged and enthusiastic ovations received by a Labour leader for many years .
Colleagues said last night that the speech marked a change of gear as Mr Kinnock moved away from party organisation and policy and accelerated into the election campaign .
They were prerequisites an unparalleled priority for dealing with inflation , the balance of payments deficit , unemployment , and funding the party 's policies for social justice .
Writing by the art critic of a newspaper is self-evidently criticism , in parallel with the writing of music and theatre critics ; an exhibition can be treated almost in the same way as a performance .

In the late twentieth century artists working in performance pose difficulties for the critic , though some observers find it refreshing rather than troublesome to consider work beyond the easel picture and the individual sculpture .
Being Zuckerman is one long performance and the very opposite of what is thought of as being oneself .
Zuckerman says here that performance is all there is , that person and persona are one .
But we may feel on reading this that it takes two to perform that performance requires , in however regressive or circular a fashion , the self that so many people believe they have , and that this epistolary Zuckerman exhibits here , in a display of inadvertence which may or may not implicate Philip Roth .
Some people find this makes theatre less believable less true to their own experience and therefore less convincing than the more restrained performances seen on television and cinema .

As part of the audience you are as much a part of the entertainment as the performance itself , and this is something that dramatists are aware of and have always written for .
And you will become aware of technical skills noticing economy of effect and style , seeing and hearing how an actor interprets a script , and how his thinking comes across in a performance .

In recent years the amateur actor has had more opportunity for classes in theatre work , including voice and movement training as well as performance and directing skills .
The selection is right if it truly works for the competing student , and it is the quality and force of the imagination that will carry off the performance of the piece .
The emphasis will be on developing an actor 's mental and physical concentration , and giving him/her sufficient craftsmanship to sustain a performance .
Ideally the classes support the work done on the production project and it is particularly valuable if there is strong liaison between voice and movement tutors with the director of a project not least in helping students see how the instructional classes connect with their own performances .
The first production The text for the first term 's production will usually be selected for the purpose of getting a new group to work together rather than trying to go for detailed individual performances .
Of course the student also needs to learn how to co-ordinate dialogue with all of the necessary actions and movements which are part of the natural traffic of performance , and learn about prop handling .
Agents are notified of performances by the schools , and they also receive hundreds of letters from students inviting them to see particular performances .
But there is the chance of working with Cicely Berry , who is so wonderful at adding in a positive , performance orientated way to all the things you have learnt about voice .
And of course holding together a part like Juliet with long gaps between the performance nights and no real rehearsal in between is difficult to do that can be rather hairy .
Sometimes you are a week away from the last performance you gave and then find yourself out there so that the voice and understanding of the part does need constant refreshing .

And later much later at the National Theatre playing the young Captain Absolute did that grow out of being seen in these performances .
I think everyone needs the director to be vitally interested in the work well beyond the first week of actual performance .
Perhaps directors in particular need to realise how much their vitality means to the continuing performance that it is n't enough to be left up on a stage merely doing it night after night .

Working quantities of organic material into the top few inches will markedly improve some plants ' performance .
The effects of rain on the stall Many pilots are unaware of the significance of dirty wing surfaces and of rain or drizzle on both the performance and the stalling characteristics of gliders .
Tests show that on most high performance machines , a spread of splattered flies on the leading edges can account for up to a quarter of the glider 's performance , reducing a glide ratio of 40 .
On a normal tow , except for very low performance machines , the climbing angle of the towplane and glider is much steeper than the glider 's gliding angle when flying downwind .
The performance of modern gliders makes it much easier and more likely for a pilot to fly himself into a potential death trap unless he uses his imagination or has already learned to have a healthy respect for the elements .
But there is little to choose between the two in terms of overall performance .

Cognitive Neuropsychology Case Studies and Group Studies Cognitive neuropsychology is the attempt to draw parallels between models of cognitive function and the patterns of performance observed in patients who have suffered Brain injury .
First , can we explain the impaired performance that these patients produce in terms of our functional models .
Their performance on some task is then evaluated by comparing their average score with the average score of a group of matched control subjects .
What might be responsible for such an unusual pattern of performance .
This pattern of performance suggests that these patients find it difficult to assemble a pronunciation , but they can continue to read familiar words because the lexical system , utilizing addressed phonology , is still working effectively .
They also claim that the players have earned this protection by the performances in the rest of the year which have brought about their rankings .

It was intended as a high - performance set which could inherit the reliability associated with previous BR DEMUs , thus beating the older , inherently unreliable diesel-mechanical multiple units hands down .
But , if underfloor engines and transmissions were to be used , they had to be in a different league of reliability and performance from the DMUs which BR had been running since the 1950s .
The second meaning of the word impetus should be applied to the actual performance of any step or pose in the purely technical sense .
However , more important is the third meaning of impetus which has also to do with physical performance .
This kind of bravura performance is only legitimate if the context and music allow the dancer to steal a little time .
Merely to count all the details that it is necessary to accumulate from the preparation of a scenario and score through rehearsal to public performance should make it clear that co-operation from other artists as well as from dancers is required .

However when Fokine staged A Night of Egypt he went a great deal further and developed a more particular Eastern style inspired by the performance of some Siamese dancers .
Its style of performance and expression change repeatedly throughout each ballet as the dancer changes with the attendant circumstances .
It is this which makes the performance capable of repetition .
This double characterisation was made more hilarious at the first performances when the bossy one was danced by Helpmann , and later the taller MacMillan , with wonderfully extended dvelopps , and the shyer one by Ashton with dainty attempts to be correct at all costs .
Moreover , the dancers involved have to take this type of performance very seriously , even though they must be able to toss off the mistakes with an air of surprised innocence .

A cask ale is brewed from the finest malting barley , produced in the main in East Anglia , with the addition of English hop varieties .
This requires great skill in encouraging the barley to germinate , producing the natural starches that will provide sugar for fermentation .

The plant produces 10 .
The other acts as a pickup coil producing a voltage proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linking it .
As an additional benefit , the closed magnetic circuit of a toroidal core greatly reduces the drive requirements to produce saturation levels , simplifying the circuitry need by the system .
10a produces the largest output , that 10b links none of the changing flux and has a null output .
Calibration The core is aligned with one coil picking up the north-south field and inclined at roughly 67 to the horizontal and adjusted so as to produce the largest positive output from the amplifier .
The output is fed to a two stage frequency divider formed from the D-type 4013 bistables , producing a final output square wave at 180Hz in both normal and inverted phases .
a toroidal core tends to concentrate the magnetic field tangentially producing the same sensitivity pattern as a pair of bar cores .

Buck According to Terrence Finnegan , the Cuk power converter offers the best of all power supply worlds , approaches 90 % efficiency , requires few components , and produces minimal amounts of interference .
Since the input and output inductors store energy , then just like any other inductor , they produce flux in their common core and they require space for large enough diameter wire to keep I2R losses reasonable .
I fully accept that in Andy Gothard 's article about King 's College , there is a circuit system developed by Dr Mark Sandler which produces a very accurate , and indeed ideal , analogue output from the digital to analogue converter .

I think that this kind of objection rests upon a false way of thinking about the information that the input system provides .
My own view is that connectionism is well placed to provide such a computational account of sensorimotor development ; but that is not the issue here .
This is an area of some controversy at the moment in psychology , where one of the holy grails is the attempt to provide empirical evidence for the intuitively reasonable idea that there can be a dissociation of behaviour from consciousness .
What I am suggesting is that introspective reports , while often providing helpful qualitative information , can never be reliable enough to use as quantitative data defining the presence or absence of conscious awareness .

The metaphysical framework for the neurophysiology of perception is provided by the Causal Theory of Perception .
scientific , and in particular physiological , observations have provided any additional , independent evidence in support of the impingement theory of perception/experience ; the impingement theory , with its physiological embellishments , goes any way towards explaining perception .
